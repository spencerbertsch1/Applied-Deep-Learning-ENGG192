# Deep-Learning
Independent study focusing in various deep learning topics - Dartmouth College, Winter 2019


## Packages and Libraries

The projects in this repository use a variety of deep learning labraries and python packages. In order to run most of the code, you will need to have both TensorFlow and PyTorch installed on your machine. Other important packages include Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

## For MacOS 
Simply open a command window and run the following commands to install the necessary libraries. 

1. Run `pip install --upgrade tensorflow` to make sure your version of TensorFlow is up to date
2. Run `pip install tflearn` 
3. If you're not using a virtual environment, Run: `sudo pip install keras` <br> 
If you're using a virtual environment, Run: `pip install keras` 
4. Run `pip3 install torch torchvision` 
5. Run `pip3 install Pandas` 
6. Run `pip3 install numpy` 
7. Run `pip3 matplotlib`
