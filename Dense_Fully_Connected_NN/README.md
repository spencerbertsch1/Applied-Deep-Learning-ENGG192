# Dense, fully connected neural networks

This section is devoted to using exclusively traditional dense, fully connected neural networks to predict the outcome of hockey games. <br>

Both tensorflow and pytorch will be used to create the netoworks. Their performance (both in terms of speed and other performanc metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, etc.) will be measured and compared. <br>
