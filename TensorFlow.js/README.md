# Deep learning in the browser

Mostly transfer learning, but there are several other forseable use cases for TensorFlow.js

A guide to Tensorflow.js can be found [here.](https://js.tensorflow.org/)

### Installing TensorFlow.js

**For OSX:** <br>
Simply open a terminal and run the command `pip install tensorflowjs`


### Importing pretrained models in Keras into TensorFlow.js

See the link to Google's page [here.](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/import-keras.html) There are a few format changes that need do be made before that transfer can happen. 

### Getting started using a script tag

The propper script tag which can be added to the initial HTML file can be found [here.](https://js.tensorflow.org/setup/)

Thank you to [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) for publishing such great tutorials on TensorFlow.js. I followed many of these tutorials to write the programs in this folder, so big thank you to him. 

Other sources include the [TensorFlow Website](https://js.tensorflow.org/) and other odds and ends for debugging.
